This is a simple shopify auto check out script for ShoePalace, and could be used for other shopify sites.

This is purley for learning purposes as I am a new to python and using web scraping, I dont reccomend actually using this script to buy anything.

As of right now I have not added sizes so the script will auto checkout the first size that is avaliable, however adding sizes can be easily added.
